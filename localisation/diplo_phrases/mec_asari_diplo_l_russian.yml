 personality_asari_ai_asr_desc:0 "Alluring Architects naturally settle into the role of mediatiors, finding common language and building bridges between nations, species and cultures. Their beguiling influence has a way of worming itself into alien societies and slowly reshaping them to better fit the Architects' perfect design."

 ASA_ASR_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Do not mistake our gentleness for weakness. Some of the loveliest flowers grow throns to survive in the wild. Try to pluck them... and you might just hurt yourself."
 ASA_ASR_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "How [From.GetSpeciesPlural] tolerate such uncooperative government is beyond me..."
 ASA_ASR_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetAllianceName]'s laws ensure a lawful and prosperous future for the civilised galaxy. It is so unfortunate that [From.GetName] has set on a course that involves neither civilisation nor future."
 ASA_ASR_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Our desire to develop closer relations with [Root.GetName] is only outweighted by your refusal to accept our good will, [From.GetRulerTitle]. That said, we are currently debating whether your approval is truly necessary."
 ASA_ASR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are still in the early days of galactic history. The sooner we embrace cooperation, the sooner we can advance to greater things and new frontiers."

 ASA_ASR_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle]. Is this some kind of game? Are you calling us just so you can cut us off again?"
 ASA_ASR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Diplomacy should be the cornerstone of all interstellar societies. The fact that [From.GetRulerName] appreciates this is surely the sign of a wise leader."

 ASA_ASR_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Have you faced an [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] commando unit before? Few [From.GetSpeciesPlural] have. I hope you consider surrender before it comes to that."
 ASA_ASR_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "It sickens me to see that the [From.GetAdj] government would drag its people into a war against the [Root.GetAllianceName] and the safe, prosperous, civilised galaxy it represents."
 ASA_ASR_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetAllianceName] stands united against the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] threat."
 
 ASA_ASR_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Do not be alarmed by the dissenting voices of uncertainty you may have heard amongst our citizens. Let us instead talk about how we might bring our respective people together! We have some proposals for you to review if you please..."
 ASA_ASR_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] directives are being followed to the letter and according to schedule. That's what you wanted to hear, was it not? Is there anything else you would like me to say?"
 ASA_ASR_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "The arrangement between us is just an unpleasant necessity, it's not because we- ugh... Just don't get the wrong idea."
 ASA_ASR_OVERLORD_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetName] should have no cause for concern. With our guidance, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] will in time reach the same heights as us."

 ASA_ASR_DOW_ACCEPT_01:0 "*Sigh* We are not angry. Or even surprised. Just... disappointed."
 ASA_ASR_DOW_ACCEPT_02:0 "Whatever your reasons are, they are misguided. [From.GetName] needs to be stopped for its own good."
 ASA_ASR_DOW_ACCEPT_03:0 "Why... would you do such a thing? What happened to our relations? How long in planning was this betrayal? No matter. Once we have restored the peace, we will cure whatever sickness has taken root in the [From.GetName]"
 
 # Insults
 ASA_ASR_01_INSULT_PROPOSE:0 "Credit where it's due, it is mostly thanks to the [From.GetName] that our citizens' interest in foreign relations has been positively *soaring* lately. They are both deeply concerned... and very entertained by your nation's constant fumbling."

 ASA_ASR_01_INSULT_ACCEPT:0 "Do not waste my time again, [From.GetRulerTitle]. I fail to find it amusing."

 personality_asari_ai_asi_desc:0 "Fashionable Financiers are a decadent capitalist society built upon lax business regulations and rampant celebrity culture. Its quadrillionaire elite seek to drive the cutting edge of technological innovation and wrap the galactic economy around their fingers by any means they can get away with."
