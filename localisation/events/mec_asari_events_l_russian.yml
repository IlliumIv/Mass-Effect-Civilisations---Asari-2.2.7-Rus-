 # Illium
 d_mec_asari_nosastra_metropolis:0 "Nos Astra Metropolis"
 d_mec_asari_nosastra_metropolis_desc:0 "The arcology skyscrapers of Illium's capital city rise high above the inhospitable surface of the planet to greet the endless shuttle traffic from all over the world and beyond into its port.\n\nNos Astra has established itself as the beating heart of Illium's commerce and tourism, situated at the nexus of several major trade routes and home to many corporate headquarters. Whether goods, entertainment, information or... anything else one might be willing to put a price tag on, Nos Astra's lavish commercial districts can either provide it or import it."
 d_mec_asari_manjoros_plaza:0 "Manjoros Plaza"
 d_mec_asari_manjoros_plaza_desc:0 "Manjoros Plaza is one of the largest population centres on Illium, housing mutliple habitation complexes, office buildings and private real estate utilised by corporations and wealthy individuals alike.\n\nThe palatial residences of galactic celebrities are quite a sight to behold... from a long distance. And through several layers of forcefields. And under constant watch by legions of private security."
 d_mec_asari_sulsara_oasis:0 "Sulsara Oasis"
 d_mec_asari_sulsara_oasis_desc:0 "The gleaming jewel of Sulsara Desert actually shines not because it reflects the scorching sunlight, but because it greedily absorbs every single ray that falls upon its solar-panelled skyscrapers, and then radiates its energy weatlh out to all of Illium.\nAlthough all major arcologies are designed to be self-sustainable in terms of power, Sulsara still makes enormous profits supplying excess energy to clients across the planet for whom enough is never enough.\nIn the long term, the Oasis seeks to cover the entire desert with its solar collectors."
 d_mec_asari_saefos_valley:0 "Saefos Valley"
 d_mec_asari_saefos_valley_desc:0 "The fertile plains of Saefos Valley and its booming population make it one of the planet's most inviting locales. While by no means rural, it is a favoured living place and tourist desitination for those who prefer the polar regions' natural beauty to the artificial skyscrapers of equatorial arcologies. Without, of course, having to leave behind urban comforts."
 d_mec_asari_makeara_bay:0 "Makeara Bay"
 d_mec_asari_makeara_bay_desc:0 "A large bay at the edge of the northern polar region, surrounded by a number of seaside settlements established in the early years of Illium's colonisation. The local fishing industry used to feed the early colonists and the bountiful marine life was highly prized offworld as expensive pets and exotic cuisine. At least until unregulated exploitation led to the extincion of many native species.\n\nInvestors' interest in Makeara Bay suddenly renewed when ongoing research on cloning presented the possibility of bringing the dearly missed delicacies back to life."
 d_mec_asari_nosedana_vertical:0 "Nos Edana Vertical Agricologies"
 d_mec_asari_nosedana_vertical_desc:0 "The agricology project of Nos Edana was an agricultural conglomerate's attempt at developing a self-sustainable arcology design during the initial wave of equatorial settlement. While the prototype was successful and the construction of Nos Edana was commissioned according to its design, the conglomerate had failed to account for Illium's rapid population growth.\nIn the end, living and commercial space was deemed too valuable to dedicate entire spires to hydroponic facilities. Polar farmlands and offworld imports became Illium arcologies' primary providers of food.\n\nNonetheless, Nos Edana has managed to carve out a niche for itself as the exclusive producer of locally grown offworld crops cultivated within highly specialised simulated environments."
 d_mec_asari_kyatari_thanoris:0 "Kyatari-Thanoris Twin Cities"
 d_mec_asari_kyatari_thanoris_desc:0 "Independently but simultanously constructed along the same mountain chain, the cities of Kyatari and Thanoris practically grew up together. At first the mining concerns that built them were in fierce competition, each vying for monopoly over the mountains' virgin mineral wealth, but as the inhabitants of the twin cities came to rely on each other's trade and complementary amenities, the companies' investors forced them to break the 126-year stalemate and enter a more productive partnership.\n\nAnd so they came together to exploit their joint infrastructure and workforce happily ever after."
 d_mec_asari_sedera_canyon:0 "Sedera Canyon"
 d_mec_asari_sedera_canyon_desc:0 "A relatively young geological formation cutting deeply into the planet's largest landmass. The canyon owes its existence to a combination of a regularly overflowing sea and convergence of tectonic plates. It is speculated that over billions of years the geological activity may lead to the complete separation of the landmass into two continents and the Sedera river to become a sea of its own.\n\nNone of that, however, is as important to the inhabitants of Illium as the vast mineral weatlh exposed by the ever-generous forces of erosion."
 d_mec_asari_equatorial_hostile:0 "£blocker£ Hostile Equatorial Surface"
 d_mec_asari_equatorial_hostile_desc:0 "The conditions in the equatorial regions of this hot and massive planet are beyond the tolerance levels of most organic species, allowing ground settlement only at the higher polar latitudes.\nHowever, their natural resources can still be exploited to an extent, and populations can escape the extreme heat of the surface by building their cities within massive skyscraper arcologies."
 d_mec_asari_equatorial_terraformed:0 "Terraformed Equatorial Surface"
 d_mec_asari_equatorial_terraformed_desc:0 "Once too hot for large-scale ground settlement, localised terraforming and climate adaptation efforts have created a lot of new space for habitation and infrastructure in the equatorial regions of Illium.\nAlthough little can be done about the high gravity of the massive planet, it has over geological aeons led to the formation of high-value minerals which are now ripe for unhindered exploitation."
 d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_quarantine:0 "£blocker£ Nos Parnalo Quarantine Zone"
 d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_quarantine_desc:0 "The city of Nos Parnalo was once a prosperous metropolis that had the potential to become Illium's centre of trade and de facto capital.\nHowever, when surveyor Verallas returned to port after the preliminary exploration of the Zelene system, unbeknownst to the crew, it brought back a handful of chlorine-fixing microbes native to the planet Nepyma.\nExposed to the temperate environment replete with unused chlorine, the microbes proceeded to reproduce, devouring the chlorides in the earth and leaving toxic polychlorinated biphenyls as metabolic byproducts.\n\nBy the time the infestation was contained, an area of nearly 30 square kilometers had been effectively turned into a toxic waste dump. Nos Parnalo had to be abandoned, accelerating the development of Nos Astra."
 d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_research:0 "Nos Parnalo Black Site"
 d_mec_asari_nosparnalo_research_desc:0 "Although there is little chance that the toxic area will support life again within a reasonable timeframe, the Nepyman microbes and their effect on the planet's environment are of some scientific interest.\n\nParts of the dead city have been repurposed into a research complex dedicated to their study, surrounded by heavy military fortifications and sentries ordered to open fire on anything that comes within weapons range without the proper clearance. Or anyone claiming to be there for a surprise inspection."
 d_mec_asari_arcology_unfinished:0 "£blocker£ Abandoned Arcology Project"
 d_mec_asari_arcology_unfinished_desc:0 "This near-equatorial arcology settlement once had the ambition of rivalling Nos Astra in size and opulence. Unfortunately, after merely establishing the foundations, the corporation that acquired the land and commissioned the city declared bankrupcy and vanished without trace, leaving this eyesore to take up valuable space and a sizeable population of workers to fend for themselves, unpaid to this day."
 
 # Thessia
 d_mec_asari_republic_armali:0 "Republic of Armali"
 d_mec_asari_republic_armali_desc:0 "One of the most powerful republics on Thessia, it can trace its origins to Athame herself. Whilst the archeological ruins within the republic continue to draw millions of visitors each year, it is in fact Armali's businesses that are the source of its wealth.\n\nHaving been at the forefront of technology and science over the past centuries, the city has the highest concentration of tech companies of any republic on Thessia. Their influence and wealth rival that of dozens of smaller republics and ensure that Armali remains the premier location for investment and business."
 d_mec_asari_nosdesera:0 "Nos Desera"
 d_mec_asari_nosdesera_desc:0 "Famous for the Tasar Helini, the tallest shopping complex on Thessia, and its prime filming location, Nos Desera is considered to be the epicentre of Thessia's vid and music industry.\n\nThe volume of credits moving through Nos Desera is considered to be on par with some of the largest republics, however, the reliance on a few key industries has limited Nos Desera's power and influence. Despite this, Nos Desera uses its access to Thessia's famous to its advantage, with some of the strictest privacy laws on Thessia, and low tax rates, the rich and famous are more than happy to promote Nos Desera as a top tourist destination."
 d_mec_asari_serrice_university:0 "The University of Serrice"
 d_mec_asari_serrice_university_desc:0 "The University of Serrice is considered to be the principal university on Thessia, most notably in the fields of biotics, archeology and astrophysics. Anyone lucky enough to be accepted into the university is almost guaranteed to succeed for the rest of their life, with many of their former students having been, and continuing to be involved in the most prestigious projects throughout asari space."
 d_mec_asari_cresyl_plateau:0 "Cresyl Plateau"
 d_mec_asari_cresyl_plateau_desc:0 "Formed during the Diodechus Period, the Cresyl Plateau is a 130km region that was once submerged under the ocean. As a result, the plateau is teeming with fossils, minerals and carbon.\n\nWhilst the majority of the region is now protected due to its outstanding natural beauty, some areas are still excavated for resources. This region continues to fuel the development of local settlements and has been vital in the development of the Asphine industrial complex. Recent estimates predict that the region could provide another thousand years worth of minerals."
 d_mec_asari_askasian_mountains:0 "Askasian Mountains"
 d_mec_asari_askasian_mountains_desc:0 "The Askasian mountain range is home to Thessia's highest peaks, as well as its most treacherous terrain. Whilst tens of thousands have now climbed to the summit of Mount Jithri, the mountain still maintains its difficulty and notoriety.\n\nRecent geological surveys have found an abundance of mineral resources deep below the range. The quantity and quality of these minerals will ensure that Thessia has a constant supply of raw resources for centuries to come. Careful excavations are underway to ensure that the mountain range above does not destabilize from any mining operations."
 d_mec_asari_pulian_delta:0 "Pulian Delta"
 d_mec_asari_pulian_delta_desc:0 "Since the advent of asari civilisation, the Pulian Delta has been a vital region for agriculture due to its fertility and biodiversity.\n\nEstimated to provide up to 8% of Thessia's food, the region has been fought over and controlled by hundreds of different nations throughout history.\nIt was not until the formation of modern e-democracies that the region was given special recognition and came to be considered the universal birthright of all asari, placed under the jurisdiction of a neutral council."
 d_mec_asari_senecan_lakes:0 "Senecan Lakes"
 d_mec_asari_senecan_lakes_desc:0 "The northern lakes of the Seneca region are renowned for their natural beauty, as well as their vital importance to the Republic of Ovida. The lakes alone are estimated to be responsible for nearly 15% of Ovidas national income due to tourism and irrigation to neighbouring republics.\n\nIn recent history, concerns grew as to the overexploitation of the lakes, with a memoriam put in place which saw an immediate ban on fishing and irrigation, nearly decimating the local agricultural industry. Now, however, the lakes are beginning to flourish once more with continued strict resource management and care."
 d_mec_asari_irssal_tea:0 "Irssal Tea"
 d_mec_asari_irssal_tea_desc:0 "The irssal plant is known across Thessia for its beautiful and vivid flowers, but most importantly, for its sweet smell and taste, Whilst the tea is easily available across Thessia, it remains a favourite due to its timeless aroma and simplicity. Maiden and Matriarch alike will be found sipping irssal tea whilst enjoying the view of the Armali skyline."
 d_mec_asari_athame_temple:0 "Temple of Athame"
 d_mec_asari_athame_temple_desc:0 "Athame, referenced to this day as "the goddess", was once a deity of prophecy and fate, as well as the matriarch of the polytheistic asari pantheon and later a monotheistic religion in which Athame oversaw all stages and roles in asari society.\n\nWhilst Athame is no longer worshipped as she once was, the Temple of Athame is more than just the glorified museum it might seem at first glance.\nHidden deep within its vaults lies an archive left behind by alien precursors, referred to as "Protheans", who once manipulated the development of asari culture, science and even genome. The Temple's secrets are known only to the highest eschelons within the government and closely guarded from even the asari people themselves for fear of discrediting their civilisation's achievements and flawless image. Even so, their technological developement continues to benefit from the precursors' knowledge."
 d_mec_asari_eezo_deposits:0 "Element Zero Deposits"
 d_mec_asari_eezo_deposits_desc:0 "The planet is awash in all forms of eezo present in water, soil, flora and even fauna, with many native lifeforms having evolved either biotic mutations or immunity.\n\nEezo makes up the backbone of Thessia's economy and sees ubiquitous use in many industrial, medicinal, scientific and consumer areas. Non-biotically adapted tourists are advised to stick to the vistors menu, as even food and drink on Thessia are typically served with small amounts of element zero."
 d_mec_asari_thessia_net:0 "Thessia Planetary Network"
 d_mec_asari_thessia_net_desc:0 "Thessia's extensive communications infrastructure synergises digital and physical networking to create a world of infinite connectivity. With free, omnipresent and nearly uninterruptible access to the planetary internet, the network permeates all aspects of culture, politics and economy, leading to the developement of a society so dependent upon social media, digital trade and networked amenities that, to many, the prospect of getting disconnected from the network would be an apocalyptic event.\n\nThe communications infrastructure was instrumental to the establishment of the modern asari government - a form of electronic democracy in which a mosaic of local and global communities would govern themselves directly without relying on elected officials. Instead, political authority would be based on one's charisma, reputation, merits and experience; the course of debates often directed by influential matriarchs and, to a lesser but notable extent, popular celebrities."
 d_mec_asari_zalis_spill:0 "Zalis Chemical Spill"
 d_mec_asari_zalis_spill_desc:0 "A privately owned chemical processing plant in the Zalis sea underwent an emergency shutdown procedure when three of the five chemical tanks began to see a significant rise in pressure. Despite the emergency shutdown, the tanks were unable to divert the needed pressure to prevent an explosion. The resulting explosion unleashed over hundred million litres of methyl isocyanate which subsequently dissolved in the sea.\n\nThe local fishing and tourism industry were shut down overnight with a forty kilometer exclusion zone put into immediate effect. Many nearby cities and towns saw their livelihoods collapse. An investigation into the disaster found that cost-cutting exercises were undertaken, including the pressure valves on the tanks. The corporation involved, ZFC Industries, and the majority of its executives were found guilty of a variety of crimes for their actions."
 d_mec_asari_zalis_sea:0 "Zalis Sea"
 d_mec_asari_zalis_sea_desc:0 "The Zalis Sea is teeming with life once again, with a large variety of creatures returning to their ancestral homes. Incredibly, the spill cleanup has led to animals that were once rare within the sea to flourish, such as the Jasuli shark. The local settlements are once again seeing their towns and lives improve as tourists flock to see the beautiful fauna and flora flourishing beneath the waves."
 d_mec_asari_yisrin_devastated:0 "Devastated Republic of Yisrin"
 d_mec_asari_yisrin_devastated_desc:0 "For over three centuries the former Republic of Yisrin stood tall amongst the cliffs of the Lifilo coast until a major earthquake destroyed much of the city. With over four hundred thousand dead and millions of refugees; the city still stands abandoned.\n\nUnfortunately, the quake also caused significant damage to the Lifilo tidal barrage, which is situated at the mouth of the Yasarow river. With enough investment the tidal barrage may once again be operational, ensuring that the region may begin the process of rebuilding the abandoned republic."
 d_mec_asari_yisrin_restored:0 "Lifilo Tidal Barrage"
 d_mec_asari_yisrin_restored_desc:0 "After a monumental investment into the Lifilo tidal barrage, and the city of Yisrin, the republic is beginning to return to its former glory. In thanks for the efforts of their asari sisters, the Republic of Yisrin is investing in developing the Lifilo tidal barrage even further. Capable of producing enough energy to power four neighbouring cities, the tidal installation is on its way to becoming one of the greatest engineering marvels on Thessia."
